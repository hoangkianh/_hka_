/*
GENERIC

styling for bare HTML elements (like H1, A, etc.).
moThese come with default styling from the browser so we can redefine them here.

OBJECTS
================================================
"formless", in other words invisible to the user, no cosmetics

Specific UI components.
This is where majority of our work takes place
